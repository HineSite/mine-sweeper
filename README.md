# Minesweeper
This is a simple clone of minesweeper, written in c#. The purpose of this simple exercise was to familiarize myself with the rules and math behind minesweeper. The ultimate objective was to turn minesweeper into something entirely different (hasnâ€™t happened yet).

Uploading some of my old projects that were made either made before I used GitHub. Based on the timestamps, this project was written in or around February of 2016.

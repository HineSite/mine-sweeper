# Minesweeper
This is a simple clone of minesweeper, written in c#. The purpose of this simple exercise was to familiarize myself with the rules and math behind minesweeper. The ultimate objective was to turn minesweeper into something entirely different.

Uploading some of my old (more interesting) projects that were made before I used GitHub. Based on the timestamps, this project was written in or around February of 2016.
